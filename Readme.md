## 🚨 Overview

FDRS (Falcons Disaster Response System) is a robust and scalable solution designed to streamline the management and coordination of disaster relief across multiple government departments. It enables affected citizens to trigger instant SOS alerts and allows authorities to coordinate actions through a centralized platform, integrated with AI-powered tools and blockchain-backed donation systems.

FDRS was created to solve real-world challenges during natural or man-made disasters by enabling transparent, secure, and real-time communication between civilians and government agencies.
